description: Use this skill whenever the user wants to operate on OpenWhispr notes, folders, transcriptions, or audio from a terminal or shell. The OpenWhispr CLI (`openwhispr` binary, npm package `@openwhispr/cli`) talks to either the local desktop app or the cloud API and exposes every operation needed for managing notes, folders, transcriptions, audio, plus auth and config. Trigger this skill when the user mentions "openwhispr cli", running shell commands against OpenWhispr, automating note workflows, cleaning up a transcription, building agent integrations against OpenWhispr, or scripting any OpenWhispr operation — even if they don't say "CLI" explicitly.

# OpenWhispr CLI

Use this reference when running the `openwhispr` command-line tool. The CLI is a single binary that operates against either the local desktop app (via a loopback HTTP bridge) or the cloud REST API. The same command works against both backends.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @openwhispr/cli
```

Requires Node.js 20 or later. Verify with `openwhispr --version`. If the user reports `command not found`, ensure their npm global bin is on `$PATH`.

## Backends

Every command runs against one of two backends. The behavior is identical from the user's perspective — only the data source differs.

| Backend | What it talks to | Use when |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **local** | Desktop app's loopback HTTP bridge on `127.0.0.1` | The desktop app is running. Authoritative during/right after a recording. |
| **remote** | `https://api.openwhispr.com/api/v1` | Desktop is closed, or running on a different machine, or the user wants cloud-side semantics. |

### How the CLI picks a backend

Resolution order (first match wins):

1. The `--local` or `--remote` flag on the command
2. The `OPENWHISPR_BACKEND` environment variable (`local`, `remote`, or `auto`)
3. The `backend` key in `~/.openwhispr/cli-config.json`
4. Auto-detect: local if the desktop bridge is reachable, otherwise remote if an API key is configured, otherwise error with guidance

### Local backend (no setup needed)

When the desktop app starts, it writes `{version, port, token}` to `~/.openwhispr/cli-bridge.json` with mode `0600`. The CLI reads it automatically. If the file is missing or stale, local is treated as unavailable.

### Remote backend (needs an API key)

Generate a key in the desktop app under **Integrations > API Keys**, then run:

```bash
openwhispr auth login    # prompts for the key, stores it 0600 in ~/.openwhispr/cli-config.json
openwhispr auth status   # confirm it works
openwhispr auth logout   # clear it
```

API keys are scoped server-side. Match scopes to the commands the user needs to run:

| Scope | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| `notes:read` | `notes list/get/search`, `folders list` |
| `notes:write` | `notes create/update/delete`, `folders create` |
| `transcriptions:read` | `transcriptions list/get` |
| `transcriptions:delete` | `transcriptions delete` |
| `usage:read` | (used internally by `doctor` and the remote backend's reachability ping) |

Scopes are enforced server-side; the CLI does not validate them locally. If a scope is missing, the API returns a 401/403 and the CLI exits with code 3.

## Output

The CLI auto-detects whether stdout is a TTY:

- TTY → human-readable (table for lists, markdown or text for single resources)
- Pipe/redirect → JSON

Override with `--format <fmt>`. Supported values vary by command:

- Lists (`notes list`, `notes search`, `folders list`, `transcriptions list`): `json|table`
- `notes get`: `json|markdown`
- `transcriptions get`: `json|text`
- `notes create`, `notes update`, `folders create`: no `--format` flag — always emit the full JSON of the created/updated resource on stdout
- Delete-style mutations (`notes delete`, `transcriptions delete`, `audio delete`) and status commands (`auth status`, `config get`, `doctor`, `version`): `--format json` for machine output; otherwise human-readable text

Always pass `--format json` when parsing CLI output programmatically.

## Exit codes

Honor these exit codes when scripting or recovering from errors:

| Code | Meaning | Recovery |
|------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1 | User error (bad args, missing required flag) | Fix the command and rerun |
| 2 | Backend unreachable | Start the desktop app, or run `auth login` for cloud, or try `--remote`/`--local` explicitly |
| 3 | Auth failure (missing/invalid key, insufficient scope) | Do not retry — surface to the user |
| 4 | Not found (no such note/transcription/folder) | Check the ID and rerun |

## Commands

Noun-verb syntax: `openwhispr <noun> <verb>`. Same convention as `gh`, `kubectl`, `aws`, `stripe`.

### Notes

```bash
openwhispr notes list [--folder <id>] [--limit N] [--format json|table]
openwhispr notes get <id> [--format json|markdown]
openwhispr notes create --content <text> | --content-file <path>
                        [--title <t>] [--folder <id>]
openwhispr notes update <id> [--content <t>] [--folder <id>] [--title <t>]
openwhispr notes delete <id> [--dry-run] [--format json]
openwhispr notes search <query> [--limit N] [--format json|table]
```

### Folders

```bash
openwhispr folders list [--format json|table]
openwhispr folders create --name <name> [--sort-order <n>]
```

Folder names must be unique per user. Create returns 409-equivalent on duplicates (exit code 1 with a clear message).

### Transcriptions

```bash
openwhispr transcriptions list [--limit N] [--format json|table]
openwhispr transcriptions get <id> [--format json|text]
openwhispr transcriptions delete <id> [--dry-run] [--format json]
```

`--format text` returns the plain transcript text body. SRT/VTT export is not currently exposed by the CLI; use `--format json` and post-process if you need timestamped subtitle formats.

### Audio

```bash
openwhispr audio delete <transcription-id> [--format json]
```

Local-only. The cloud API does not store audio. Running this with `--remote` returns a clear "not supported" error (exit 1).

### Auth

```bash
openwhispr auth login [--api-key <key>]   # prompts on stdin if --api-key omitted
openwhispr auth status [--format json]
openwhispr auth logout
```

`auth status` reads the stored config and reports whether a key is configured — it does **not** make a network call. To verify the key actually works, use `openwhispr doctor`.

### Config

```bash
openwhispr config get [--format json]
openwhispr config set backend auto|local|remote
openwhispr config set api-base https://api.openwhispr.com
```

Only `backend` and `api-base` are settable via `config set`. The API key is managed through `auth login`/`auth logout`. `api-base` is overridable for self-hosted or staging deployments (default: production cloud). The `OPENWHISPR_API_BASE` env var also overrides it for a single invocation.

### Doctor

```bash
openwhispr doctor [--format json]
```

Probes both backends and reports each independently. Exit 0 if at least one is reachable; exit 2 if neither. Run this first when the user reports "the CLI isn't working" — it isolates whether the problem is the desktop bridge, the API key, or something else.

### Version

```bash
openwhispr --version    # or: openwhispr version
```

## Workflows

### Bulk note operations

Pipe `notes list --format json` through `jq` for filtering, then iterate:

```bash
openwhispr notes list --limit 100 --format json | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.title | contains("draft")) | .id' | \
  while read id; do
    openwhispr notes delete "$id"
  done
```

### Searching for context before writing a note

```bash
openwhispr notes search "quarterly budget" --format json | jq '.[].id'
```

Use the IDs returned to read related notes with `notes get` before composing the new note's content.

## Configuration files

The CLI reads/writes these files. Both should always be `0600`.

| File | Written by | Contains |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `~/.openwhispr/cli-bridge.json` | The desktop app at startup | `{version, port, token}` for the loopback bridge |
| `~/.openwhispr/cli-config.json` | The CLI's `auth login` and `config set` | `{backend, apiBase, apiKey}` |

The CLI writes both files with `0600`. If you see them with looser permissions (e.g., after manual editing), tighten with `chmod 0600 <file>`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| `Backend unreachable` (exit 2) on every command | Desktop closed and no API key | Start desktop, or `openwhispr auth login` |
| `Auth failed` (exit 3) on remote commands only | API key revoked, expired, or missing scope | Regenerate key with the right scopes |
| `Not found` (exit 4) on a known-existing note | Wrong backend — the note is on the other side, not yet synced | Try the opposite backend (`--local` or `--remote`) |
| Config file readable by other users | File created or edited outside the CLI | `chmod 0600 ~/.openwhispr/cli-config.json` |

## Programmatic invocation

When invoking from another program, always pass `--format json` and parse stdout. Inspect the exit code first — non-zero codes (1–4) follow the table above. On error, the CLI writes a plain-text message to **stderr** (not JSON) and exits with the relevant code; capture stderr separately to surface it to users.

Successful list/search responses print a bare JSON array (the CLI strips the API's `{data: [...]}` envelope before printing), so `jq '.[]'` is correct, not `jq '.data[]'`. Single-resource gets print the bare object.
